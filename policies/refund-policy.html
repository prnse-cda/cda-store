    <p class="section-text">We use handwoven material for our products; therefore, it may have some irregularities in weaves and can't be considered a defect.</p>
    <p>We can't give any guarantees on colour fastness. Natural dyes like indigo will bleed during the first wash and we cannot offer any returns/exchanges in such cases.</p>
    <p>Slight colour variation may occur due to the differences in the display settings of your monitor, tablets, and mobile devices. And we can't offer an exchange or refund in these situations.</p>
    <p>Please read the wash and care instructions. Damage caused by employing the wrong methods of wash and care will not be considered as the reason for exchange/ refund.</p>
